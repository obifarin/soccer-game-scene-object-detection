# soccer-game-scene-object-detection
 Using YOLOv3 for detecting popular objects in a soccer game scene

## Goal
A soccer game scence object detector using training data from Googleâ€™s Open Images Dataset (Open images V6).
Objects to be detected: 
- Football
- Footwear
- Person
- Glove
- Human face

## Method and Results (In short)
Pulled images from Open Images via OIDv4 toolkit
Collected 300 images and annotations for each class of object
Training in darknet framework
Configurations for Training
Batch = 64
Classes = 5
Max_batches = 10000 (2000 X no of classes used for training)
Steps = 8000, 9000 (80% and 90% of iteration)
Filters (no of class + 5) X 3 = 30
Transfer learning protocols
Pre-trained weights from darknet53.conv.74: trained on coco datasets
Training  
On google colab GPU for 15 hours
Results
Average loss 0.72
